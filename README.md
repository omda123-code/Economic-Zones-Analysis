# Economic Zones & Enterprise Analysis

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of enterprise distribution, investment levels, export earnings, and job creation across various economic zones. The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for policymakers, investors, and stakeholders seeking to understand the regional economic landscape and identify opportunities for growth.

## Objectives

* Analyze the number of enterprises and investment per zone.
* Examine export earnings by product category and by country.
* Assess job creation across zones and product sectors.
* Identify correlations between investment, enterprise count, and employment levels.
* Provide actionable insights and recommendations to improve regional economic development.

## Data Sources

* **Zone Data**: Information about economic zones, land, special free zones, total investment, export earnings, and new job opportunities.
* **Enterprise Data**: Details of enterprises, investing countries, and products.
* **Incentives Data**: Tax exemptions, incentives, and regulatory benefits provided to enterprises.

## Analysis

The project includes:

* Zone-level analysis for investment, exports, and employment.
* Product-level analysis for job creation and enterprise distribution.
* Country-level analysis for export earnings.
* Key metrics such as Average Investment per Enterprise, Total Investment, Number of Enterprises, Export Earnings, and Jobs Created.
* Data visualizations (charts) prepared in Python for interactive and static analysis.
